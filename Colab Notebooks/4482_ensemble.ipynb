Ensemble methods tend to perform better than their more simple counterparts, but as you will see below it's not always quite that simple. Just throwing an ensemble method at a problem won't always improve on score, the algorithm must be implemented correctly to take advantage of the classifiers strengths and minimize the weaknesses. \n","\n","One easy to see tradeoff is complexity.
