In this notebook we will be exploring two new items. \n","\n","* The first will be learning how to use the MultiLayerPerceptron Algorithm. In the case that we start introducing hidden layers one would call this \"Deep Learning\" and \"Deep Neural Network\" which is an extremely powerful modeling technique. \n","\n","* The second concept which is extremely relevant for DNN is the selection of and tuning of hyperparameters. This selection can be computationally expensive and time consuming. For this we introduce sklearn's gridsearchcv to help us search/explore the parameter space without having to code this manually. \n","\n","* The notebook will begin by simply creating MLP models with various numbers of layers and a variety of neurons in each layer with the models becoming more computationally expensive and complex. Pay attention to the metrics to see if this complexity has actually improved our predictions. DNNs are notorious for overfitting data because they can become arbitrarily complex. \n","\n","* After you have grasped the primary concept of the DNN we will introduce other hyperparameters that are often tuned to improve the model, and finally we will introduce gridsearchcv to bring this code complexity back down to a reasonable effort.

Another common tuning hyperparameter is learning rate. This is the rate at which the weights are adjusted and has two primary benefits. The first is that a learning weight can impact the models ability to learn more quickly or slowly and second that it can help the model stay out of local minima and hopefully find the globbal minumum
