On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people such as women, children, and the upper-class were more likely to survive than others.\n","\n","VARIABLE

addressed which was not explained in the video is the fact that we are using a single Categorical model here for Naive Bayes. The sklearn package doesn't support using a single model for both Gaussian (continuous ie 1.3,2.5,1.98 etc) data as well as categorical data such as A,B,C. This means that two models need to be fit in order to achieve the same predictions as the R package e1071 which can handle multiple variable types. At the root of this is the fact that in R factor variables are intended to be created in the data transformation phase, and then the model itself can use this information to use a gaussian model for continuous data and categorical model for categorical data. In python we do not code factor data in quite the same way and so the models do not support this outof the box. \n","\n","To resolve this issue we predict with both models on their respective data and then do a tiny bit of math using what we know about bayes formula to get back to a single classification prediction.
