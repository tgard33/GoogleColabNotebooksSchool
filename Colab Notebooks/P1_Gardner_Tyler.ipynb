The import command brings the specific functionaility or library to the python script/code in the notebook. The 'as' creates an alias for the library that is being imported. For example. 'as' tells python that you're going to call the pandas library and functions as 'pd' from now on throughout the notebook.\n","\n","A library in the terms of python/programming is a collection of files that contain functions for use by other programs. These libraries help eliminate writing code from scratch by using the functions/tools that are built within the libraries. We need to import these libraries into our notebooks so that when we want to use the tool or function it provides our code knows what we are referencing.\n","\n","**Pandas**\n","\n","pandas is a python package that helps make working with relational or labeled data easier. Pandas help with reading and writing data, data alignment, missing data, reshaping, grouping, merging and joining. pandas aim is to be the high-level building block for working with practical, real world data analysis.\n","\n","I need the pandas library for many things throughout this notebook. First off I need it to import the data from my google drive using the pd.read_csv() function. I also need it in task 5 to use the pd.crosstab function for target exploration by predictors within the dataset. I also need to use it to Data encode my dataframe and target variable using the pd.get_dummies() function.\n","\n","**Numpy**\n","\n","Numpy's library/package is used for mathematical and logical operations on arrays. It also helps with fourier transforms and toutines for shape manipulation. Many of the numpy operations are related to linear algebra. Numpy has built in functions for linear algebra and random number generation.\n","\n","I need the Numpy library/package to be able to do my column by column exploration in task 3 to find values in columns such as the mean, meadian, min, and max. It also is used in task 3 to do algebraic calculations such as finding the range using the min and max values of a column as well as the percentiles of column data.\n","\n","**sklearn**\n","\n","sklearn is a machine learning module for python that integrates classical machine learning algorithms for popular python packages such as numpy and matplotlib. This package/library contains many tools for machine learning and statistical modeling in classification models, regression models, and clustering and dimensionaility reduction. From sklearn you can import some of the many tools/functionalities it offers.\n","\n","I need the sklearn package/library so I can use cross validation, split my model into training and test sets, get performance metrics and build models such as decision trees.

By default, the crosstab command computes a frequency table of the factors unless an array of values and an aggregation function are passed. The reason I chose to do this is because it shows the relationship between the categories within a categorical column as a proportion when you add the 'normalize=True' parameter and you are able to see each categories relationship with the two categories within the target variable.

the following code block a decision tree model is built using the sklearn package/library. Decision trees are a good model to use when you are trying to evaluate a classification task. A decision tree is similar to a flow chart. Within the decision tree there are nodes and branches. The nodes represent certain features and outcomes while the branches represent rules based on decisions made from the data. The idea behind a decision tree algorithm is that it selects the best attribute using attribute selection measures to split the records. It then makes that attribute a decision node an dbreaks the dataset into smaller subsets and starts building a tree by repeating this process recursively for each child until one of the conditions match whether it be all the tuples belong to the same attribute value or there are no more remaining attributes or ther are no more instances. \n","\n","In the following code block the decision tree model is created using the DecisionTreeClassifier from the Sklearn library using the encoded dataframe and encoded target variable. The sklearn.utils.validation.check_is_fitted is used to verify if the model is fitted correctly. If it is fitted correctly it runs normal without errors, if not there is an output stating so. The reason I chose to do this is because it is best practice to verify your code runs correctly.

The decision tree model was above 0.50 for all of the performance metrics and even had a high accuracy even though it is not the best metric for this dataset. The other data sets did not have the consistancy or scores to really compete or compare with the decision tree model. With that being said, the decision tree model seems to have a lot of overfitting issues within the model that need to be addressed and considered. The only model that did not appear to have any overfitting or underfitting issues was the SVM model.

I will also use the recall, precision, and accuracy metric. The F1 seems to carry the most weight for the decision of the analysis and comparison for this dataset. With that being said, another metric I would put worth considering is the precision score. The reason this is almost as important is beacuse a high precision score relates to a low false positive rate.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UYOscRf2MnFp"},"source":["Describe the strengths and weaknesses of each metric. \n","\n","The F1 score is a good metric because it is the weighted average of precision and recall. One of its strengths is that it takes both the false positives and false negatives into account. One of the weaknesses however is that it is not as easy to understand as accuracy, but F1 is usually more useful than accuracy as well, especially when you have an imbalanced target variable like we do. \n","\n","The precision score helps when the costs of false positives are high. For example if it detects that many of the people in our data make over 50K a year, people will expect that but really not make more than 50K a year. Essentially it ignores the false positives after being bombarded with false alarms. One of its strengths is focusing on the correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. A strength to this as well is high precision relates to the low false postive rate. A weakness of precision could be that it refers to how close measurements of the same item are to each other and that it is independent of accuracy, but that can also be a strength too. If the cost of false positives and false negatives are very different, it’s better to look at both Precision and Recall so by itself it may not stand strong.\n","\n","The recall score helps when the cost of false negatives is high. It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. The strength of the recall metric is that it checks to see how correct it was in labeling the correct labels to all the observations in a given class. If the cost of false positives and false negatives are very different, it’s better to look at both Precision and Recall so by itself it may not stand strong.\n","\n","Accuracy metric is useful and is a strength because it is the most intuitive performance measure. Usually it is a good metric to use but a weakness is that it is only a GREAT measure when you have symmetric datasets where values of false positves and false negatives are almost the same. Since our dataset is not symmetric in that way, it is not the best metric to use."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Vi51OocvMP8B"},"source":["# Task 9 - Comparison to Baseline"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"25argGBmMsZW"},"source":["## Comparison Analysis"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kgnjoNaaMuvZ"},"source":["How much better are your models than the majority classifier?\n","\n","The majority classifier was at 0.76.

Even if I were to pick one metric and base my recommendation of the best model to use off that one metric it would still be the decision tree model. \n","\n","On the other hand given that the decision tree model is suffering some overfitting in its model, I would recommend the SVM model becuase of how well the precision score is from this model.

The SVM model beat the decsion tree metric with a precision score of 0.97. The reason I would still go with the decision tree over the SVM model is because of the other metrics and overall accuracy of the decision tree model. The F1 score of the SVM model is the worst out of all the models.
